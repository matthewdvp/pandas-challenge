PyCity Schools Analysis
Schools with higher budgets did not necessarily yield better test results compared to schools with lower budgets. Schools with a budget of 645-675 dollars per student underperformed compared to those with a smaller budget of 585 dollars per student.

Smaller and medium-sized schools outperformed large-sized schools on passing math performances, with 89-91% of students passing math in smaller and medium-sized schools versus 67% in large-sized schools.

Charter schools outperformed public district schools in all areas measured, but further analysis is needed to determine whether this success is due to their practices or their tendency to serve smaller student populations per school.
